The following code is a modification of the code presented in the early chapters of "XNA 4.0 Game Development by Example: Beginner's Guide" by Kurt Jaegars. The purpose of this project was to become familiar with XNA and C#, both of which I was unfamiliar with at the time. I modified some parts and changed various things, but for the most part the code maintains the same structure as the original and uses the same techniques for solving problems. All the artwork is also from the resources provided with the book.
